# br-chip8
Simple implementation of a Chip 8 interpreter written in C++ for practice purposes.
This is my first emulation project and I hope to move onto more complex machines in the future.

## Install
Just run make, depends on opengl.

## Running
  ./br-chip8 rom.c8

## Controls
The square of keys with corners 1, 4, z, and v corresponds to the keypad on the Chip 8.
